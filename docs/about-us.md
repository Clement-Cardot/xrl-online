    As Product Owner, I ensured that the customer's request corresponded to our work product. My job was also to propose ideas or alternatives to the customer in order to get their opinion. During this project, I was also in charge of maintaining the CICD pipeline and I was the maintainer of our gitlab repository, so each merge request had to be validated by the pipeline and myself before being merge.

## Maxence Le Du

    As the Scrum Master and design lead in this project, my primary role was to facilitate the Scrum process and ensure the team met its objectives efficiently. I played a key part in coordinating and communicating within the team, ensuring everyone understood and adhered to Scrum principles and practices while keeping up to date the project's progress. In design, almost all decisions were made under my supervision before any action. I worked closely with every member of the team to ensure features met client needs while adhering to best design practices.
