# JUnit + Mockito

To test our back-end, we use JUnit and Mockito. JUnit is a unit testing framework for Java. Mockito is a mocking framework for Java. It allows us to mock objects and to test our code in isolation.

We have decided to tests only the services and the controllers. We have not tested the repositories because they are automatically generated by Spring Data JPA and we have not tested the models because they are very simple and do not contain any logic.

Our goal is to keep a coverage of at least 80% for the services and the controllers. We reach a coverage of around 98%.

As JUnit and Mockito are very popular, we won't go further into the details.

Please refer to the [JUnit documentation](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/) and the [Mockito documentation](https://javadoc.io/doc/org.mockito/mockito-core/latest/org/mockito/Mockito.html) for more information.
