## Docker

This project is deployable with docker. You can find the docker-compose file in the root of the project.

Docker compose will create 2 containers:

- The first one is the database container. It will run a MongoDB instance.

- The second one is the web application container. It will run a Tomcat instance with the front & back applications.

To run the project with docker, you need to have docker and docker-compose installed on your machine.

Then, you can run the following command:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

## MongoDB

MongoDB is a NoSQL database. It is used to store the data of the application.<br>
We use the official MongoDB docker image to run the database.<br>
Our database is composed of 5 collections:

- Business Lines
- Projects
- Readiness Levels
- Teams
- Users

## CI/CI

The CI/CD is managed by GitLab CI/CD. The configuration file is located in the root of the project.<br>
The pipeline is composed of 4 stages:

- build : Build the front & back applications
- test : Run the unit tests of back-end and the e2e tests with cypress
- sonar : Run the sonar analysis
- deploy : Deploy the application on the dev server // TODO

## Build Script

We have created a build script to test the dev env and build the project.<br>
Use the Build_Script.sh file in a shell env (git bash)

This script will :

1. Remove any artifact from last build
2. Build the Angular app
3. Build the Spring Boot app
4. Build the DB script
5. Deploy Front/Back/BDD with a docker compose
