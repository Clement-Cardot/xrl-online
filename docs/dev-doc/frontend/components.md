# Components

Each component is a folder with the following structure:

- `component-name.component.html` - the component template
- `component-name.component.scss` - the component styles
- `component-name.component.ts` - the component class

We have grouped some components in folders :

- the `charts` folder contains all the components related to charts.
- the `dialogs` folder contains all the components related to dialogs.
- the `object-cards` folder contains all the components related to object cards.

To better understand how components work and how to create them, you can read the [Angular documentation](https://angular.io/guide/architecture-components).
